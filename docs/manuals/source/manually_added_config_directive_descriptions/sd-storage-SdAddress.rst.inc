This directive is optional, and if it is specified, it will cause the Storage daemon server (for Director and File daemon connections) to bind to the specified IP-Address, which is either a domain name or an IP address specified as a dotted quadruple. If this and the :config:option:`sd/storage/SdAddresses`\  directives are not specified, the Storage daemon will bind to any available address (the default).
